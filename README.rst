This **LITE CharGen for Traveller** is a Classic Python 2.5 program for generating NPCs for Traveller. For now, it'll just be generating each Traveller's name, age, UPP, and sex.


The Traveller game in all forms is owned by Far Future Enterprises.

Requirements
------------

* **Windows XP/7/8/10**

   It might not work in OSX or Linux.

* **bottle 0.12.13**

   The plan is to view the generated Travellers in the web browser.
   
* **colorama 0.2.7**

   Because the dice roller may have some colored text messages for debugging. The colorama
   code in diceroll.py can be removed if it is not needed, however.
